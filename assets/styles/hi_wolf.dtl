Ranger\: Hey big fella.
Ranger\: Are you trying to talk me into something?
Ranger\: I have this crazy idea... wait, am I actually crazy to talk to a wolf.
Ranger\: Lately there's a lot of illegal hunting in the park. It's been stressful handling them in a small team, you know..
Ranger\: What do you say, wolfie? Bau bau? Ruff ruff?
Wolf\: (HERE'S MY CHANCE! I'LL TALK TO HIM THROUGH MY SMARTS!)
