Ranger\: Oho. Aren't you a really smart wolf? Those words are no nonsense. 
Ranger\: And a very good intention too! I saw you handling that baby cougar, baby puma, quite well.
Ranger\: I'll give this message to my seniors. They might consider to run a Puma Conservation Campaign for some months.
Ranger\: My team will check on that puma's health, so please stop by.

- *howls*
Ranger\: In the meantime, still, be careful with human stuffs. Thank you, my forest hero!
