Wolf\: After some talks, the rangers are unable to stop the mining operations.
Wolf\: I heard that they'll explode other part of the mine for something they call 'oil'.. it's Deer's territory!
Wolf\: It's been a full moon since Puma got healed. I feel bad involving her in this mission.. But somehow her kin's ability is needed by me.
Puma\: Don't feel bad, Mr. Wolf! I am happy to be taken for a stroll! I can teleport you for a bit and I have telepathy, right? 
Wolf\: Can I trust you?
Puma\: Oh you. I want to return the favor, right? Now hush and seek for some clues, or even help!
- Good luck, and please don't push yourself.
- Don't you 'hush' me! I'm older than you!
